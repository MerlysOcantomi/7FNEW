/**
 * Workspace Tasks — shared types and validation constants.
 *
 * This module defines the future global work-item contract. PR 2 ships
 * the foundation only:
 *   - Prisma model `WorkspaceTask`
 *   - Migration script `scripts/migrate-workspace-task.ts`
 *   - Type/constant skeleton + thin service in `./service.ts`
 *
 * Nothing reads from or writes to `WorkspaceTask` yet:
 *   - `/today` still aggregates `InboxTodo`, `Tarea`, `Evento`.
 *   - `New → New task` still writes through `POST /api/inbox/todos`.
 *   - `Fanny` is unchanged.
 *
 * Naming note: "Tasks" is the user-facing brand for the global work
 * system; the Spanish `Tarea` model stays as a deeper project/CRM
 * sub-record and may be linked from a `WorkspaceTask` via `tareaId`
 * in a later PR.
