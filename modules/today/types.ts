/**
 * Today aggregator — public types.
 *
 * `Today` is a read-only, workspace-level view that surfaces the work the operator
 * should look at first thing in the morning. As of PR 4 the canonical task source
 * is `WorkspaceTask`, with `Evento` still feeding calendar items and `Tarea`
 * surviving as a fallback for legacy CRM rows that have not yet been mirrored
 * into `WorkspaceTask`. `InboxTodo` is no longer queried directly — its rows
 * reach Today via the dual-write mirror established in PR 3.
 *
 * The shape lives in its own module so the API route, the aggregator, and the
 * client components can all import the SAME contract — drift between server
 * payload and client expectations is a recurring source of bugs in this codebase.
 *
 * NB: brand neutrality is enforced at the boundary. `TodaySource.kind` uses the
 * neutral term `"inbox"` (operator-facing copy is `"From Inbox"`); we do NOT
 * surface "InboxTodo" or "WorkspaceTask" as UI labels anywhere downstream.
 */

/**
 * Normalised priority across underlying taxonomies.
 *
 * Source mapping:
 *   - `WorkspaceTask.priority` : "low" | "normal" | "high" | "urgent"
 *   - `Tarea.prioridad`        : "baja" | "media" | "alta" | "urgente"
 *
 * Both `"urgent"` and `"urgente"` collapse to `"critical"` so the UI can pick a
 * single visual treatment per tier without branching on origin.

/**
 * Provenance of the underlying record. Used by the UI to render the chip on the
 * right of each row ("From Inbox", "From <project>", "From Calendar", "Task")
 * and to decide where a click should navigate.
 *
 * `href` is always a relative path inside the app — never an absolute URL — so
 * the client component can render `<Link>` without sanitisation.
 *
 * Source resolution priority for `WorkspaceTask` rows (highest → lowest):
 *   conversationId → `inbox`
 *   tareaId        → `project` (link goes to the underlying Tarea page)
 *   proyectoId     → `project` (link goes to the project page)
 *   otherwise      → `manual` (no upstream source yet — chip says "Task")
